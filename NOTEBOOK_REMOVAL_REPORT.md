# Jupyter Notebook Removal Report

## Summary
A comprehensive search was conducted to identify and remove all Jupyter notebooks from the telemetry-pipeline repository.

## Findings
- **No Jupyter notebook files (.ipynb) found** in the current repository
- **No historical notebook files found** in the git history
- **No notebook-related files found** with various naming patterns

## Search Methods Used
1. Recursive file search for `*.ipynb` files
2. Git history search for any previously committed notebook files
3. Pattern matching for files containing "jupyter" or "notebook" references
4. Comprehensive search for various notebook file extensions (`.ipynb`, `.nb`)

## Conclusion
The telemetry-pipeline repository is already clean of Jupyter notebooks. No removal action was necessary.
