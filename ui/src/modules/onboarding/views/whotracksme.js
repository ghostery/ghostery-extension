      <ui-text>
        WhoTracks.Me, operated by Ghostery, is an integral part of Ghostery’s AI
        anti-tracking technology. It is a comprehensive global resource on
        trackers, bringing transparency to web tracking.
      </ui-text>
      <ui-text>
        It exists thanks to micro-contributions of every Ghostery user who
        chooses to send non-personal information to WhoTracks.Me. The input
        enables Ghostery to provide real-time intel on trackers which in turn
        provides protection to the entire Ghostery community.
