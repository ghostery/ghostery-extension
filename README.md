## Development

First, install dependencies and download additional resources (e.g. block lists):

```bash
npm ci
```

Then, start the local version of the extension in Chrome:

```bash
npm start
```

You can add the target after the `start` command to run the extension in a different browser:

* Firefox - `npm start firefox`
* Opera - `npm start -- --browser=opera`
* Edge - `npm start -- --browser=edge`
* Safari (MacOS) - `npm start safari-macos`
* Safari (iOS) - `npm start safari-ios`

> The build script assumes that you are using macOS, and browsers are installed in the default locations

To run local version in Safari, you have to use Xcode as well. The project files are available in the `xcode` folder, but Apple's ecosystem is more complex. Fortunately, most changes can be tested reliably in Chrome.
