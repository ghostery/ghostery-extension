# Ghostery DNR Extension

Ghostery helps you browse smarter by giving you control over ads and tracking technologies to speed up page loads, eliminate clutter, and protect your data.

This repository contains a version built with the new `chrome.declarativeNetRequest` API allowing it to be used in Safari. For non-Safari browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Edge, we recommend using the "classic" [Ghostery browser extension](../extension-manifest-v2) instead, which is built on the older, but more capable webRequest API.

## Local development

First, you need to install JavaScript dependencies and download additional resources (e.g. block lists):

```sh
$ npm ci
```

Now everything is ready. Change the code, and run it in Chrome:

```sh
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

To test it in Safari, you will have to use Xcode. The project files are available in the `xcode` folder, but Apple's ecosystem is more complex. Fortunately, most changes can be tested reliably in Chrome.

If you want to contribute, try to get it working in Chrome. Most of the time, your code will work in Safari, too.

## Locales

Use the [Transifex client](https://docs.transifex.com/client/introduction) to push the new translations to the server. Use the following steps:

1. `npm run locales` for updating the web extension part
2. `npm run xcode-export-locales` for generating the `en.xliff` file
3. `tx push` to upload the updated source files to the Transifex

For pulling translated messages run `tx pull`. However, for the native part, open project in Xcode, and use the `Import Localizations` feature with the resources directly downloaded from the Transifex.`
