## Internationalization

This project is configured to use the Transifex CLI. See their [documentation](https://docs.transifex.com/client/installing-the-client) to get started. *Note*:  You do not need to run `tx config` as the project [configuration file](.tx/config) has already been generated.

Generate a Transifex API Token [link](https://www.transifex.com/user/settings/api/)

```sh
# Configure the Transifex CLI
$ tx init
```

```sh
# Submit translation files to Transifex
$ tx push -s
```

```sh
# Download translated files from Transifex
$ tx pull -a
```

```sh
# Add the placeholders into the downloaded translation files.
$ node tools/transifex.js
```

## Tracker Databases
The [databases](/databases) folder contains JSON skeletons to show the schema expected by the extension pattern [matcher](/src/utils/matcher.js). See the [Database README](/databases/README.md) for more information.
Ghostery's production tracker databases have been purposely excluded from this project, as they remain proprietary to Ghostery, Inc. Which leads us to this grim, yet obligatory...

You may not use these databases or any portion thereof for any purpose that is not expressly granted in writing by Ghostery, Inc. All inquires should be sent to [legal@ghostery.com](legal@ghostery.com).  Ghostery, Inc. retains the sole discretion in determining whether or not to grant permission to use the databases. Unauthorized use of the databases, or any portion of them, will cause irreparable harm to Ghostery, Inc. and may result in legal proceedings against you, seeking monetary damages and an injunction against you, including the payment of legal fees and costs.
